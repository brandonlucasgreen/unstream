# Unstream
Unstream is a simple app that helps you find music you love outside the streaming ecosystem. It recommends platforms better suited to support the makers of that music, as well as free community alternatives to streaming apps provided by local libraries.

I was inspired to build it when exploring my own journey to reduce my usage of streaming services, both for movies and music.

While exploring Bandcamp specifically, I was struck by just how many bands I knew and loved had posted music for sale on Bandcamp - including longtime favorites like Radiohead and Fountains of Wayne. I started building Unstream and while testing it found even more artists I could directly support over time rather than contributing to the streaming ecosystem.

There are technically two apps here:
1. A web app that facilitates artist searching (including deeplinking from a Spotify or Apple Music profile)
2. A native macOS app that does the same, plus (optionally) suggests alternative platforms based on what's currently playing in Music.app or Spotify.app
