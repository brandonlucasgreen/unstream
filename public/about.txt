**Unstream is a simple app that helps you find music you love outside the streaming ecosystem.** It recommends platforms better suited to support the makers of that music, as well as free community alternatives to streaming apps provided by local libraries. 

I was inspired to build it when exploring my own journey to reduce my usage of streaming services, both for movies and music. 

While exploring Bandcamp specifically, I was struck by *just how many bands I knew and loved* had posted music for sale on Bandcamp - including longtime favorites like Radiohead and Fountains of Wayne. I started building Unstream and while testing it found even more artists I could directly support over time rather than contributing to the streaming ecosystem. 

# FAQ 

### Why are these platforms Unstream recommends better than Spotify / Apple Music / my streaming app of choice?

### What are the problems with streaming my music?

### How much money does the artist get when I buy their music?
- **Faircamp sites:** varies, based on the artist’s preferred payment method (typically ~90-97% of sale price)
- **Ampwall:** ~92-95% of sale price [(source)](https://ampwall.com/selling)
- **Mirlo:** ~86-90% of sale price [(source)](https://mirlo.space/pages/about)
- **Bandcamp:** ~80-85% of sale price [(source)](https://bandcamp.com/fair_trade_music_policy)
- **Qobuz:** ~70% of sale price [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/esy440/comment/ffcxlql/)

*More details:* All online transactions involving a credit card transaction incur credit card fees, which are typically ~2.9% of the purchase price, plus an additional 30 cents. This is always applied on top of a platform’s fee, which is why the above percentage values vary a bit. 

### Why can’t you link to Ko-fi, Ampwall, or Buy Me A Coffee profiles for the artists I search for?
Basically, it’s a technical limitation. These platforms hide their searches from external sources, meaning we can’t link directly to an artist profile on these sites in an automated way.  The best alternative is to search those platforms manually, which Unstream offers in the results.
