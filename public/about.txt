**Unstream is a simple app that helps you find music you love outside the streaming ecosystem.** It recommends platforms better suited to support the makers of that music, as well as free community alternatives to streaming apps provided by local libraries. 

I was inspired to build it when exploring my own journey to reduce my usage of streaming services, both for movies and music. 

While exploring Bandcamp specifically, I was struck by *just how many bands I knew and loved* had posted music for sale on Bandcamp - including longtime favorites like Radiohead and Fountains of Wayne. I started building Unstream and while testing it found even more artists I could directly support over time rather than contributing to the streaming ecosystem. 

# FAQ 

### What’s the problem with streaming? Why are the platforms Unstream recommends better than Spotify / Apple Music / my streaming app of choice?
Well, for one, the owners of these platforms don’t [actively invest in militarization efforts](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-chairman-ai-military-million-investment/) 😅

But Spotify and its former CEO are not the only problems with the streaming model for music. Streaming is a consumer-friendly service offering access to almost the entire history of recorded music in a convenient subscription, but a tiny fraction of your subscription actually goes to the artists who make the music – and you have no control over _which_ artists they go to. 

The exceptions are artists with hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners or more; while many are rightfully deserving of those listeners, the economics of streaming (especially on Spotify) disproportionately benefit those artists thanks to the outsized influence of the 3 major record labels. Smaller artists are effectively shut out from making money in the streaming ecosystem, and increasingly shut out of promotional opportunities to even grow their audience in this ecosystem as well thanks to an increased focus on AI and algorithms. What’s more: streaming platforms, and the incentives they run on, are being flooded with AI-generated music, often created solely for the purposes of exploiting streaming algorithms and capturing more listeners (and thus revenue).

The platforms suggested by Unstream primarily focus on a _direct-support_ model, meaning you pay to _own_ an artist’s music (or support them with a monthly subscription) and the majority of your payment goes to the rights holder of the music – which in many cases is the artist themselves. 

We also link to a number of alternative services that can help you reduce your dependency on streaming, such as _more artist-friendly_ streaming/downloading platforms (like Qobuz) or renting music through your local library (via the services Hoopla and Freegal).

### Why did you build this?
A few reasons! First, [I am a musician](https://kidlightbulbs.com) who’s grown disenchanted by the streaming ecosystem, and I ended up finding much more success building an audience on my own on Bandcamp. I ended up making over $2200 in two years, despite having not performed any of this music live and a tiny following online. I’ve now seen the success of pursuing this path as an independent musician, and I want to encourage fellow artists explore these alternative platforms as homes for their music.

As a consumer, I’ve paid for streaming services for over a decade, mostly Apple Music. But I’ve wanted to cancel it and build my own library of owned music – to rediscover the joy of finding new music myself, to give Apple less of my money, and to give more of that money to the artists whose music I love. In exploring this, I learned _just how many_ of my favorite artists post & sell their music on Bandcamp.

I built Unstream to serve both of these purposes: help fellow listeners find better ways to support the artists they love more easily, build their own libraries, and ultimately reduce their dependency on streaming, while also encouraging fellow artists to trust & use these alternative models rather than relying on streaming as a conduit to success.

### How much money does the artist get when I buy their music?
- **Faircamp sites:** varies, based on the artist’s preferred payment method (typically ~90-97% of sale price)
- **Ampwall:** ~92-95% of sale price [(source)](https://ampwall.com/selling)
- **Mirlo:** ~86-90% of sale price [(source)](https://mirlo.space/pages/about)
- **Bandcamp:** ~80-85% of sale price [(source)](https://bandcamp.com/fair_trade_music_policy)
- **Qobuz:** ~70% of sale price [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/esy440/comment/ffcxlql/)
- **Patreon:** ~86-90% of sales or memberships [(source)](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/11111747095181-Creator-fees-overview)
- **Buy Me a Coffee:** ~92% of sales or memberships [(source)](https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/articles/8105744-how-to-calculate-charges-on-your-payment)
- **Ko-fi:** ~97% of tips, ~92% of sales [(source)](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002506494-Does-Ko-fi-take-a-fee)

*More details:* All online transactions involving a credit card transaction incur credit card fees, which are typically ~2.9% of the purchase price, plus an additional 30 cents. This is always applied on top of a platform’s fee, which is why the above percentage values vary a bit. 

### Why can’t you link to Ko-fi, Ampwall, or Buy Me A Coffee profiles for the artists I search for?
Basically, it’s a technical limitation. These platforms hide their searches from external sources, meaning we can’t link directly to an artist profile on these sites in an automated way.  The best alternative is to search those platforms manually, which Unstream offers in the results.

### How does Hoopla and Freegal work? How does this support the artist?
Hoopla and Freegal are services offered through public libraries in the US. To access music through them, you’ll most often need a library card from your local library to create an account. Once you do, you’ll be able to _rent_ music on demand. More on Hoopla’s and Freegal’s limits [here](https://www.hoopladigital.com/faq) and [here](https://www.freegalmusic.com/faq).

**Do artists get paid when their music is listened to via one of these services? Unclear, and likely not.** However: you now have access to a vast back catalog of music without your money going to a giant tech conglomerate, and you’ve found one more way to support your local library.

### What are some of the other benefits of moving off a streaming service?
Lots!
- Save money
- Curate your own music library and tastes
- Discover new music through the recommendations of friends & tastemakers rather than an algorithm designed to keep you paying
- Support the artists you actually like, rather than the ones signed to the 3 major record labels
- Support your local library
